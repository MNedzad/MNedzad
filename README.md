 <h1 style="color: red;">Pleased to meet you. Im Nedzad Mahmutovic </h1>

<h2>About Me:</h2>
<p>I, nedzad, a young enthusiast of 19, embarked upon a journey into the realm of programming a mere four years ago. In that time, I've dabbled in various programming languages, driven more by curiosity and the joy of learning, than any desire for accolades. However, my interest in this field blossomed into a more serious pursuit two years hence, during which I acquired fundamental knowledge of programming through the aid of online courses such as FreeCodeCamp and w3schools. </p>
<h2>Skills:</h2>
<p>JavaScrpit, C++, Java, Node.js, react, MySQL, TypeScript, HTML, Css</p>
