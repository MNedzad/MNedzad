<h3>About Me:</h3>
<p>My name is nedzad and I'm 19 years old. I started programming 4 years ago. During that time, I've worked with different programming languages. I did this more as a hobby and out of curiosity. I started taking programming seriously two years ago and gained basic knowledge about programming through online courses (freecodecamp, w3schools). My focus was more on understanding programming than on collecting certificates </p>
